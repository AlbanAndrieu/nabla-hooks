# Dev Containers

Devcontainers are a way of making sure anyone is able to work on and install the project. It's a good way of keeping track of dependencies and making it so that dev environments are standard and everyone has access to the same tools without interfering with their local machine.

The dev container should always build.

## Configuration

- Store configs in `.devcontainer/` directory
- Include `devcontainer.json` with VS Code extensions
- Define custom `postCreateCommand` for setup
- Use forwarded ports for services

## Features

- Install only dev-specific tools (linters, formatters, debuggers)
- Configure pre-commit hooks in container
- Mount local SSH keys via `ssh-agent`
- Share volumes for caching dependencies

## Workflow

- Document container usage in project `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- Ensure IDE settings are consistent for all team members
