## Drawing Extensive Form Trees

For Mermaid Diagrams:
1. Label the infosets. Draw dotted lines between nodes of the same infoset
2. Label the players and color them using some unique coloring scheme.
3. Generate the tree root on the left and branch it out to the right.
4. Players use a closed circle as the node and chance/nature uses an open circle.
5. Edges should be labeled with the action taken
6. Terminal nodes should be marked with their payoffs.
