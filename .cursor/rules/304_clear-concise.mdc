# Clear & Concise

Your goal is to make whatever is attached in context clear and concise without sacrificing quality or information. If the content is from the document, make sure to edit the document directly. If there are any other rules attached, follow those while trying to be clear and concise. If any information seems important to include in the document, ask the user if they would like you to include it.
