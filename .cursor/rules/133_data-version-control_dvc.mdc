# Data Version Control (DVC)

For managing data, make sure to use Data Version Control (DVC). Do not use Git LFS, that system is rittled with errors

## Core DVC Commands

- `dvc init` - Initialize DVC in project
- `dvc add <file/dir>` - Track data file/directory
- `dvc push` - Push data to remote storage
- `dvc pull` - Get latest data from remote
- `dvc repro` - Reproduce pipeline/experiments

## Conventions

- Store data in `data/` directory
- Define pipelines in `dvc.yaml`
- Keep ML metrics in `metrics.json`
- Document data sources in `data/README.md`
