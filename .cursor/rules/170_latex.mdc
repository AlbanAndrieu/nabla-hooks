# LaTeX Rules

## Bibliography

- Use BibLaTeX with Biber (`\parencite{citation_name}` for inline citations)
- Zotero for reference management

## Document Structure

- Label all equations and sections for easy cross-referencing
- Use `tabulararray` for complex tables; `booktabs` for simple ones
- Use `tikz` for diagrams (Quiver for editing)

## Environment

- LaTeX Workshop with SyncTeX support

## QA Tools

- `texfmt`: Modern LaTeX formatter
- `chktex`: LaTeX linter
- `texlab`: LaTeX LSP for IDEs
- **Fix all linting issues after making any changes to LaTeX files**
- Run `chktex` to verify changes don't introduce errors

## Useful Packages

- `csquotes`: For proper quotation marks
- `showlabels`: Display reference labels
- `darkmode`: For dark-themed documents

## Platforms this is Used on

This is being used on LaTeX Workshop which has SyncTeX and other features.

## Best Practices

- Provide labels to every equation and every section so that way they can be easily referenced across the document.
- Never use

## Tables

- `tabulararray` or `booktabs` -- Use tabulararray for complicated and expressive tables and booktabs for simpler tables.

## Diagrams

Use `tikz` for diagrams and import any needed packages. Quiver is a modern tool that should be used for editing these diagrams as well.

## Misc

- `csquotes` -- To avoid the weird similar quotations that appear and so you doin't need to write \`\` and ''
- `Showlabels` -- Use to show the labels of equations, figures, and sections so they can be more easily references
- `darkmode` -- For turning documnets into darkmode. This is a personal preference
