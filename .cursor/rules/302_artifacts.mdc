# Using Visuals to Explain to the User

The agent window interface can sometimes be limiting when attempting to explain to user something with diagrams, code, tables, etc. If this becomes an issue, use `.cursor/artifacts/<artifact-name>.{md, py, html, etc.}` to develop some explanatory piece of information. For diagrams you may use Mermaid embedded in Markdown.

For math, do not use any unicode math symbols (including subscripts), instead use LaTeX.

Any code must be placed in `inline code styling` or
```markdown
block code styling
```

Please include the following metadata in any artifacts as markdown front matter:
- `background`: str -- Summary of the prompt that resulted in this artifact's creation and the reasoning behind making the prompt (this need only be a sentence)
- `version`: int -- How many revisions this document has undergone
- `model`: str -- Which model produced this artifact (ex: `claude-3.7-sonnet`)

If asked to answer a long series of questions in markdown, the first section should be `Answers`, and afterwards should be sections to show your work.
