# FastAPI rules

- Use type hints for all function parameters and return values
- Use Pydantic models for request and response validation
- Use appropriate HTTP methods with path operation decorators (@app.get, @app.post, etc.)
- Use dependency injection for shared logic like database connections and authentication
- Use background tasks for non-blocking operations
- Use proper status codes for responses (201 for creation, 404 for not found, etc.)
- Use APIRouter for organizing routes by feature or resource
- Use path parameters, query parameters, and request bodies appropriately
